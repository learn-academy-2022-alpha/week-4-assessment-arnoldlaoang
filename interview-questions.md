# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What are props in React?

Your answer:

- Props means the properties in React that can be called out and passed through to relay informations.

Researched answer:

- Through my research I learned that in React, props is a keyword that contains information and relayed from one component to another as parameters. Props is read-only, relayed from parent to child via HTML attributes.

2. What is a DOM event?

Your answer:

- DOM esentially represents all the contents that you see in the browser page and the events are actions that occur as a result of a user action changing the DOM tree.

Researched answer:

- Through my research I learned that the DOM event is a just a way to track any sort of changes on the Documewnt Object Model (DOM) through utilizing event listeners. I also learned that there are 7 DOM event types which are User Interface Events, Focus Events, Mouse Events, Wheel Events, Input Events, Keyboard Events and Composition Events.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:

- OOP or object-oriented programming is focused more on the concept of "objects" in programming the way we humans indentify the world around us and classify these things and translate to the computer.

Researched answer:

- Through my research I learned that object-oriented programming is a better way we human's express the concepts of the world around us and translate them in programming like using class as human, object as name, properties as email and methods as send email for example. OOP is pretty much a way in programming where we took in account a easier way for us to incorporate human perspective classifying objects.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:

- The difference between a float and an integer in Ruby is that it still means the same thing from what we generally know in programming in a sense that Float still represents numbers with decimals and that Integer still represents whole numbers and both able to be positive or negative numbers.

Researched answer:

- Through my research I learned that the difference between a float and an integer in Ruby is that there aren't much difference in meaning when it comes to float still having decimals and integer is still a whole number, both can be positive or negative. The difference is more so the rules that must be followed in Ruby one of the examples is by not being able to use commas in big numbers like 1,000 for example but instead it must be rewritten 1_000 by replacing the comma by using underscore.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:

- The implicit return in Ruby means that the keyword "return" is not necessary to use at the end of your code unlike what we are used to doing in javascript because in Ruby it already does it automatically.

Researched answer:

- Through my research I learned that in Ruby, implicit return means that it is a way to minimalize your code in Ruby (which is the very essence of Ruby in itself), by not utilizing the keyword "return" at the end of your code because in Ruby every block will automaitcally return the value of the last line and using return can cause errors.

1. Instance Variable:

- I learned that Instance Variable in OOP object-oriented programmming, it's variable defined in a class but is not a class variable.

2. PostgreSQL:

- I learned that PostgreSQL is a type of Structured Query Language (SQL) and it looks ar database through the OOP object-oriented programming point-of-view.

3. Ruby on Rails:

- I learned that Ruby on Rails is written in Ruby and that it's a server-side web application framework.

4. ORM:

- I learned that ORM or Object-realtional mapping is a technique that creates a layer between the language and the database.

5. Active Record:
